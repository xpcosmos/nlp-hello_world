# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Exploration

This project is an exploration of the main concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python. It involves the analysis of textual data to gain insights and perform various NLP tasks. Here, we discuss the libraries used and provide an overview of the preprocessing steps.

## Libraries Used
- **cartopy==0.22.0**: A library for cartographic projections and geospatial data visualization.
- **matplotlib==3.7.2**: A widely used library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **mayavi==4.8.1**: An interactive 3D visualization tool for scientific data.
- **networkx==3.1**: A Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
- **numpy==1.25.2**: The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- **pandas==2.0.3**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Pillow==10.0.0**: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) that adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.
- **scipy==1.11.2**: A library used for scientific and technical computing.
- **seaborn==0.12.2**: A data visualization library based on Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

## Preprocessing Example

Below is an example of data preprocessing, where we demonstrate the use of NLP libraries and techniques on a dataset. This preprocessing step prepares the data for further analysis and NLP tasks:

1. **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or tokens.
2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Assigning grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb) to each token.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities such as names, dates, and locations in the text.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluating the sentiment or emotional tone of a sentence.

These preprocessing techniques help transform unstructured text data into structured and analyzable formats.
